# CLEVER CHALLENGE

## Why this repository is public

The original repository provided for the challenge already contains the Pexels API key in a public setting. Because my repository is a fork, I wasn't able to change its visibility.

If this were a real-world project, I would take the following precautions:

- Move the API key to a secure environment variable.
- Avoid committing it to the repository.
- Never share sensitive keys in the README or version control.

Since the original setup is already public, this repo remains public as well â€” but in a production environment, this would be handled securely.
